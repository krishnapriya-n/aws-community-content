### Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD in Practice with AWS CDK

_DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools to increase development velocity to deliver apps. In general, practicing DevOps enable organizations to better serve customers and compete effectively in the market. Infrastructure as Code and release pipeline with CI/CD are two of best practices in DevOps, and considered the best entry for developers who just getting started with DevOps. Join us in this session to understand how we can implement IaC and CI/CD using AWS Cloud Development Kit. We will show you a step-by-step demos to help you get started. After this session, you will understand the overall concept of IaC and CI/CD, AWS services you need to use and developer tool for seamless integration with your development workflow._

### Let's Build Serverless Apps. Wait, Why?

Serverless is an operating model, where we delegate various activities that do not provide value to our business to other parties. By delegating these things, we can focus on improving business logic and not worrying about infrastructure.
At the end, serverless enables us to have less code, less liability, better integration, better application, more focus, more values to deliver. These are the real values for developers.
This talk will describe few reasons why adopting AWS serverless services might be a good approach for you.

### Accelerate Modern Application Development with Containers

Containers are a powerful way for developers to package and deploy their applications. They are lightweight and provide a consistent, portable software environment for applications to easily run and scale anywhere. However, deploying our containers still creates another layer of complexity. This talk focused on how you can easily deploy, release and run containerized applications using Amazon ECS, integration with Amazon ECR, and using AWS Copilot to streamline the process.

### A Pragmatic Introduction to Microservices

Microservices are not new and are increasingly becoming the preference of developers to develop their systems. However, despite the various tutorials available, there are still few that explain microservices from a practice perspective for beginners. This talk begins by explaining why microservices use the team journey on Amazon.com, and will also explain the important differences between monoliths and microservices. After that, we will also discuss how to implement asynchronous communication using an event-driven architecture. The key takeaway is for beginners to understand the basic characteristics of microservices via demos.
