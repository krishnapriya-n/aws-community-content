### Let's Build Serverless Apps. Wait, Why?

Serverless is an operating model, where we delegate various activities that do not provide value to our business to other parties. By delegating these things, we can focus on improving business logic and not worrying about infrastructure.
At the end, serverless enables us to have less code, less liability, better integration, better application, more focus, more values to deliver. These are the real values for developers.
This talk will describe few reasons why adopting AWS serverless services might be a good approach for you.
